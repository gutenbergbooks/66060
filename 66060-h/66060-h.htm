  <h2 class='c008'>GENERAL PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The eleven volumes of this edition contain all,
save one, of the dramas which Henrik Ibsen himself
admitted to the canon of his works. The
one exception is his earliest, and very immature,
tragedy, <cite>Catilina</cite>, first published in 1850, and republished
in 1875. This play is interesting in
the light reflected from the poet’s later achievements,
but has little or no inherent value. A
great part of its interest lies in the very crudities
of its style, which it would be a thankless task to
reproduce in translation. Moreover, the poet
impaired even its biographical value by largely
rewriting it before its republication. He did not
make it, or attempt to make it, a better play, but
he in some measure corrected its juvenility of
expression. Which version, then, should a translator
choose? To go back to the original would
seem a deliberate disregard of the poet’s wishes;
while, on the other hand, the retouched version
is clearly of far inferior interest. It seemed advisable,
therefore, to leave the play alone, so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>as this edition was concerned. Still more clearly
did it appear unnecessary to include <cite>The Warrior’s
Barrow</cite> and <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite>, two early plays which
were never admitted to any edition prepared by
the poet himself. They were included in a
Supplementary Volume of the Norwegian collected
edition, issued in 1902, when Ibsen’s life-work
was over. They have even less intrinsic
value than <cite>Catilina</cite>, and ought certainly to be
kept apart from the works by which he desired
to be remembered. A fourth youthful production,
<cite>St. John’s Night</cite>, remains to this day in manuscript.
Not even German piety has dragged it
to light.</p>

<p class='c012'>With two exceptions, the plays appear in their
chronological order. The exceptions are <cite>Love’s
Comedy</cite>, which ought by rights to come between
<cite>The Vikings</cite> and <cite>The Pretenders</cite>, and <cite>Emperor and
Galilean</cite>, which ought to follow <cite>The League of
Youth</cite> instead of preceding it. The reasons of
convenience which prompted these departures
from the exact order are pretty obvious. It
seemed highly desirable to bring the two Saga
Plays, if I may so call them, into one volume;
while as for <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite>, it could not
have been placed between <cite>The League of Youth</cite>
and <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> save by separating its two
parts, and assigning <cite>Caesar’s Apostasy</cite> to Volume V.,
<cite>The Emperor Julian</cite> to Volume VI.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the translations of all the plays in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>edition, except <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite> and <cite>Brand</cite>, I am
ultimately responsible, in the sense that I have
exercised an unrestricted right of revision. This
means, of course, that, in plays originally translated
by others, the merits of the English version
belong for the most part to the original translator,
while the faults may have been introduced, and
must have been sanctioned, by me. The revision,
whether fortunate or otherwise, has in all cases
been very thorough.</p>

<p class='c012'>In their unrevised form, these translations have
met with a good deal of praise and with some
blame. I trust that the revision has rendered
them more praiseworthy, but I can scarcely hope
that it has met all the objections of those critics
who have found them blameworthy. For, in some
cases at any rate these objections proceeded from
theories of the translator’s function widely divergent
from my own—theories of which nothing,
probably, could disabuse the critic’s mind, save a
little experience of the difficulties of translating
(as distinct from adapting) dramatic prose. Ibsen
is at once extremely easy and extremely difficult
to translate. It is extremely easy, in his prose
plays, to realise his meaning; it is often extremely
difficult to convey it in natural, colloquial, and yet
not too colloquial, English. He is especially fond
of laying barbed-wire entanglements for the translator’s
feet, in the shape of recurrent phrases for
which it is absolutely impossible to find an equivalent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>that will fit in all the different contexts. But
this is only one of many classes of obstacles which
encountered us on almost every page. I think,
indeed, that my collaborators and I may take it as
no small compliment that some of our critics have
apparently not realised the difficulties of our task,
or divined the laborious hours which have often
gone to the turning of a single phrase. And, in
not a few cases, the difficulties have proved sheer
impossibilities. I will cite only one instance.
Writing of <cite>The Master Builder</cite>, a very competent,
and indeed generous, critic finds in it “a curious
example of perhaps inevitable inadequacy....
‘Duty! Duty! Duty!’ Hilda once exclaims in a
scornful outburst. ‘What a short, sharp, stinging
word!’ The epithets do not seem specially apt.
But in the original she cries out ‘Pligt! Pligt!
Pligt!’ and the very word stings and snaps.” I
submit that in this criticism there is one superfluous
word—to wit, the “perhaps” which qualifies “inevitable.”
For the term used by Hilda, and for the
idea in her mind, there is only one possible English
equivalent: “Duty.” The actress can speak it so as
more or less to justify Hilda’s feeling towards it;
and, for the rest, the audience must “piece out our
imperfections with their thoughts” and assume
that the Norwegian word has rather more of a
sting in its sound. It might be possible, no doubt,
to adapt Hilda’s phrase to the English word, and
say, “It sounds like the swish of a whip lash,” or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>something to that effect. But this is a sort of
freedom which, rightly or wrongly, I hold inadmissible.
Once grant the right of adaptation,
even in small particulars, and it would be impossible
to say where it should stop. The versions
here presented (of the prose plays, at any rate)
are translations, not paraphrases. If we have ever
dropped into paraphrase, it is a dereliction of
principle; and I do not remember an instance.
For stage purposes, no doubt, a little paring of
rough edges is here and there allowable; but even
that, I think, should seldom go beyond the omission
of lines which manifestly lose their force in
translation, or are incomprehensible without a
footnote.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Introductions to previous editions I have
always confined myself to the statement of biographical
and historic facts, holding criticism no
part of my business. Now that Henrik Ibsen has
passed away, and his works have taken a practically
uncontested place in world-literature, this reticence
seemed no longer imposed upon me. I have consequently
made a few critical remarks on each
play, chiefly directed towards tracing the course
of the poet’s technical development. Nevertheless,
the Introductions are still mainly biographical,
and full advantage has been taken of the stores of
new information contained in Ibsen’s Letters, and
in the books and articles about him that have
appeared since his death. I have prefixed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span><cite>Lady Inger of Östråt</cite> a sketch of the poet’s life
down to the date of that play; so that the
Introductions, read in sequence, will be found
to form a pretty full record of a career which,
save for frequent changes of domicile, and
the issuing of play after play, was singularly
uneventful.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Introductions to <cite>Loves Comedy</cite> and <cite>Brand</cite>,
as well as the translations, are entirely the work
of Professor Herford.</p>

<p class='c012'>A point of typography perhaps deserves remark.
The Norwegian (and German) method of indicating
emphasis by spacing the letters of a word,
<em class='gesperrt'>thus</em>, has been adopted in this edition. It is
preferable for various reasons to the use of italics.
In dramatic work, for one thing, emphases have
sometimes to be indicated so frequently that the
peppering of the page with italics would produce
a very ugly effect. But a more important point is
this: the italic fount suggests a stronger emphasis
than the author, as a rule, intends. The spacing
of a word, especially if it be short, will often escape
the eye which does not look very closely; and
this is as it should be. Spacing, as Ibsen employs
it, does not generally indicate any obtrusive stress,
but is merely a guide to the reader in case a
doubt should arise in his mind as to which of two
words is intended to be the more emphatic. When
such a doubt occurs, the reader, by looking closely
at the text, will often find in the spacing an indication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>which may at first have escaped him. In
almost all cases, a spaced word in the translation
represents a spaced word in the original. I
have very seldom used spacing to indicate an
emphasis peculiar to the English phraseology.
The system was first introduced in 1897, in the
translation of <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>. It has no
longer even the disadvantage of unfamiliarity,
since it has been adopted by Mr. Bernard Shaw
in his printed plays, and, I believe, by other
dramatists.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Just thirty years have passed since I first put
pen to paper in a translation of Ibsen. In October
1877, <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> reached me hot from the
press; and, having devoured it, I dashed off a
translation of it in less than a week. It has since
cost me five or six times as much work in revision
as it originally did in translation. The manuscript
was punctually returned to me by more than one
publisher; and something like ten years elapsed
before it slowly dawned on me that the translating
and editing of Ibsen’s works was to be one of the
chief labours, as it has certainly been one of the
greatest privileges, of my life. Since 1887 or
thereabouts, not many months have passed in
which a considerable portion of my time has not
been devoted to acting, in one form or another,
as intermediary between Ibsen and the English-speaking
public. The larger part of the work, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>actual bulk, I have myself done; but I have had
invaluable aid from many quarters, and not merely
from those fellow workers who are named in
the following pages as the original translators
of certain of the plays. These “helpers and
servers,” as Solness would say, are too many to
be individually mentioned; but to all of them,
and chiefly to one who has devoted to the service
of Ibsen a good deal of the hard-won leisure of
Indian official life, I hereby convey my heartfelt
thanks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The task is now ended. Though it has involved
not a little sheer drudgery, it has, on the whole,
been of absorbing interest. And I should have
been ungrateful indeed had I shrunk from drudgery
in the cause of an author who had meant so
much to me. I have experienced no other literary
emotion at all comparable to the eagerness with
which, ever since 1877, I awaited each new play
of Ibsen’s, or the excitement with which I tore
off the wrapper of the postal packets in which the
little paper-covered books arrived from Copenhagen.
People who are old enough to remember
the appearance of the monthly parts of <cite>David
Copperfield</cite> or <cite>Pendennis</cite> may have some inkling
of my sensations; but they were all the intenser
as they recurred at intervals, not of one month,
but of two years. And it was not Ibsen the
man of ideas or doctrines that meant so much
to me; it was Ibsen the pure poet, the creator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of men and women, the searcher of hearts,
the weaver of strange webs of destiny. I can
only trust that, by diligence in seeking for the
best interpretation of his thoughts, I have paid
some part of my debt to that great spirit, and to
the glorious country that gave him birth.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LADY INGER OF ÖSTRÅT</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='c011'>Henrik Johan Ibsen was born on March 20, 1828,
at the little seaport of Skien, situated at the head of a
long fiord on the south coast of Norway. His great-great-grandfather
was a Dane who settled in Bergen
about 1720. His great-grandmother, Wenche Dischington,
was the daughter of a Scotchman, who had
settled and become naturalised in Norway; and Ibsen
himself was inclined to ascribe some of his characteristics
to the Scottish strain in his blood. Both his
grandmother (Plesner by name) and his mother, Maria
Cornelia Altenburg, were of German descent. It has
been said that there was not a drop of Norwegian blood
in Ibsen’s composition; but it is doubtful whether
this statement can be substantiated. Most of his male
ancestors were sailors; but his father, Knud Ibsen,
was a merchant. When Henrik (his first child) was
born, he seems to have been prosperous, and to have
led a very social and perhaps rather extravagant life.
But when the poet was eight years old financial
disaster overtook the family, and they had to withdraw
to a comparatively small farmhouse on the
outskirts of the little town, where they lived in
poverty and retirement.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>As a boy, Ibsen appears to have been lacking in
animal spirits and the ordinary childish taste for
games. Our chief glimpses of his home life are due
to his sister Hedvig, the only one of his family with
whom, in after years, he maintained any intercourse,
and whose name he gave to one of his most beautiful
creations.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> She relates that the only out-door amusement
he cared for was “building”—in what material
does not appear. Among indoor diversions, that to
which he was most addicted was conjuring, a younger
brother serving as his confederate. We also hear of
his cutting out fantastically-dressed figures in pasteboard,
attaching them to wooden blocks, and ranging
them in groups or tableaux. He may be said, in short,
to have had a toy theatre without the stage. In all
these amusements it is possible, with a little goodwill,
to divine the coming dramatist—the constructive
faculty, the taste for technical legerdemain (which
made him in his youth so apt a disciple of Scribe),
and the fundamental passion for manipulating fictitious
characters. The education he received was of the
most ordinary, but included a little Latin. The subjects
which chiefly interested him were history and
religion. He showed no special literary proclivities,
though a dream which he narrated in a school composition
so impressed his master that he accused him
(much to the boy’s indignation) of having copied it
out of some book.</p>

<p class='c012'>His chief taste was for drawing, and he was anxious
to become an artist; but his father could not afford
to pay for his training.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> At the age of fifteen, therefore,
he had to set about earning his living, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>apprenticed to an apothecary in Grimstad, a town on
the south-west coast of Norway, between Arendal and
Christianssand. He was here in even narrower social
surroundings than at Skien. His birthplace numbered
some 3000 inhabitants, Grimstad about 800. That he
was contented with his lot cannot be supposed; and
the short, dark, taciturn youth seems to have made an
unsympathetic and rather uncanny impression upon
the burghers of the little township. His popularity
was not heightened by a talent which he presently
developed for drawing caricatures and writing personal
lampoons. He found, however, two admiring friends
in Christopher Lorentz Due, a custom-house clerk,
and a law student named Olë Schulerud.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first political event which aroused his interest
and stirred him to literary expression was the French
Revolution of 1848. He himself writes:<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> “The times
were much disturbed. The February revolution, the
rising in Hungary and elsewhere, the Slesvig War—all
this had a strong and ripening effect on my development,
immature though it remained both then and
long afterwards. I wrote clangorous poems of encouragement
to the Magyars, adjuring them, for the
sake of freedom and humanity, not to falter in their
righteous war against ‘the tyrants’; and I composed
a long series of sonnets to King Oscar, mainly, so far
as I remember, urging him to set aside all petty
considerations, and march without delay, at the head
of his army, to the assistance of our Danish brothers
on the Slesvig frontier.” These effusions remained
in manuscript, and have, for the most part, perished.
About the same time he was reading for his matriculation
examination at Christiania University, where
he proposed to study medicine; and it happened that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>the Latin books prescribed were Sallust’s <cite>Catiline</cite> and
Cicero’s Catilinarian Orations. “I devoured these
documents,” says Ibsen, “and a few months later my
drama [<cite>Catilina</cite>] was finished.” His friend Schulerud
took it to Christiania, to offer it to the theatre and to
the publishers. By both it was declined. Schulerud,
however, had it printed at his own expense; and soon
after its appearance, in the early spring of 1850, Ibsen
himself came to Christiania.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>For the most part written in blank verse, <cite>Catilina</cite>
towards the close breaks into rhyming trochaic lines
of thirteen and fifteen syllables. It is an extremely
youthful production, very interesting from the biographical
point of view, but of small substantive
merit. What is chiefly notable in it, perhaps, is the
fact that it already shows Ibsen occupied with the
theme which was to run through so many of his works—the
contrast between two types of womanhood, one
strong and resolute, even to criminality, the other
comparatively weak, clinging, and “feminine” in the
conventional sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Christiania Ibsen shared Schulerud’s lodgings,
and his poverty. There is a significant sentence in
his preface to the re-written <cite>Catilina</cite>, in which he tells
how the bulk of the first edition was sold as waste
paper, and adds: “In the days immediately following
we lacked none of the first necessities of life.” He
went to a “student-factory,” or, as we should say, a
“crammer’s,” managed by one Heltberg; and there he
fell in with several of the leading spirits of his generation—notably
with Björnson, A. O. Vinje, and Jonas
Lie. In the early summer of 1850 he wrote a one-act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>play, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Kiæmpehöien</cite></span> (<cite>The Warrior’s Barrow</cite>), entirely
in the sentimental and somewhat verbose manner of
the Danish poet Oehlenschläger. It was accepted by
the Christiania Theatre, and performed three times,
but cannot have put much money in the poet’s purse.
With Paul Botten-Hansen and A. O. Vinje he co-operated
in the production of a weekly satirical paper, at
first entitled <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Manden</cite></span> (<cite>The Man</cite>), but afterwards
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Andhrimner</cite></span>, after the cook of the gods in Valhalla.
To this journal, which lasted only from January to
September 1851, he contributed, among other things,
a satirical “music-tragedy,” entitled <cite>Norma, or a
Politician’s Love</cite>. As the circulation of the paper
is said to have been something under a hundred, it
cannot have paid its contributors very lavishly. About
this time, too, he narrowly escaped arrest on account
of some political agitation, in which, however, he had
not been very deeply concerned.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile a movement had been going forward in
the capital of Western Norway, Bergen, which was to
have a determining influence on Ibsen’s destinies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Up to 1850 there had been practically no Norwegian
drama. The two great poets of the first half of the
century, Wergeland and Welhaven, had nothing dramatic
in their composition, though Wergeland more
than once essayed the dramatic form. Danish actors
and Danish plays held entire possession of the Christiania
Theatre; and, though amateur performances
were not uncommon in provincial towns, it was generally
held that the Norwegians, as a nation, were
devoid of all talent for acting. The very sound of
Norwegian (as distinct from Danish) was held by
Norwegians themselves to be ridiculous on the stage.
Fortunately Olë Bull, the great violinist, was not of
that opinion. With the insight of genius, he saw that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>the time had come for the development of a national
drama; he set forth this view in a masterly argument
addressed to the Storthing; and he gave practical
effect to it by establishing, at his own risk, a Norwegian
Theatre in Bergen. How rightly he had
judged the situation may be estimated from the fact
that among the raw lads who first presented themselves
for employment was Johannes Brun, afterwards
one of the greatest of comedians; while the first
“theatre-poet” engaged by the management was none
other than Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<p class='c012'>The theatre was opened on January 2, 1850; Ibsen
entered upon his duties (at a salary of less than £70 a
year) in November 1851.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Incredibly, pathetically small, according to our
ideas, were the material resources of Bull’s gallant
enterprise. The town of Bergen numbered only
25,000 inhabitants. Performances were given only
twice, or, at the outside, three times, a week; and the
highest price of admission was two shillings. What
can have been attempted in the way of scenery and
costumes it is hard to imagine. Of a three-act play,
produced in 1852, we read that “the mounting, which
cost £22 10s., left nothing to be desired.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ibsen’s connection with the Bergen Theatre lasted
from November 6, 1851, until the summer of 1857—that
is to say, from his twenty-fourth to his thirtieth
year. He was engaged in the first instance “to assist
the theatre as dramatic author,” but in the following
year he received from the management a “travelling
stipend” of £45 to enable him to study the art of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>theatrical production in Denmark and Germany, with
the stipulation that, on his return, he should undertake
the duties of “scene instructor”—that is to say,
stage-manager or producer. In this function he seems
to have been—as, indeed, he always was—extremely
conscientious. A book exists in the Bergen Public
Library containing (it is said) careful designs by him
for every scene in the plays he produced, and full
notes as to entrances, exits, groupings, costumes, accessories,
&amp;c. But he was not an animating or inspiring
producer. He had none of the histrionic vividness of
his successor in the post, Björnstjerne Björnson, who,
like all great producers, could not only tell the actors
what to do, but show them how to do it. Perhaps it
was a sense of his lack of impulse that induced the
management to give him a colleague, one Herman
Låding, with whom his relations were none of the
happiest. Ibsen is even said, on one occasion, to have
challenged Låding to a duel.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the duties of the “theatre-poet” was to
have a new play ready for each recurrence of the
“Foundation Day” of the theatre, January 2. On
that date, in 1853, Ibsen produced a romantic comedy,
<cite>St. John’s Night</cite>. This is the only one of his plays
that has never been printed. From the accounts of
those who have seen the manuscript, it would appear
to be a strange jumble of fantastic fairy-lore with
modern comedy or melodrama. Perhaps it is not quite
fanciful to regard it as a sort of half-way house between
<cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite> and <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>.
In one of its scenes there appears to be an unmistakable
foreshadowing of the episode in the Troll-King’s
palace (<cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, Act II., Sc. 6). The play
had no success, and was performed only twice. For
the next Foundation Day, January 2, 1854, Ibsen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>prepared a revised version of <cite>The Warrior’s Barrow</cite>,
already produced in Christiania. A year later,
January 2, 1855, <cite>Lady Inger of Östråt</cite> was produced—a
work still immature, indeed, but giving, for
the first time, no uncertain promise of the master
dramatist to come.</p>

<p class='c017'>In an autobiographical letter to the Danish critic
Peter Hansen, written from Dresden in 1870, Ibsen
says: “<cite>Lady Inger of Östråt</cite> is the result of a love-affair—hastily
entered into and violently broken off—to
which several of my minor poems may also be
attributed, such as <cite>Wild-flowers and Pot-plants</cite>, <cite>A
Bird-Song</cite>, &amp;c.” The heroine of this love-affair can
now be identified as a lady named Henrikke Holst,
who seems to have preserved through a long life the
fresh, bright spirit, the overflowing joyousness, which
attracted Ibsen when she was only in her seventeenth
year. Their relation was of the most innocent. It
went no further than a few surreptitious rambles in
the romantic surroundings of Bergen, usually with a
somewhat older girl to play propriety, and with a bag
of sugar-plums to fill up pauses in the conversation.
The “violent” ending seems to have come when the
young lady’s father discovered the secret of these excursions,
and doubtless placed her under more careful
control. What there was in this episode to suggest,
or in any way influence, <cite>Lady Inger</cite>, I cannot understand.
Nevertheless the identification seems quite
certain. The affair had a charming little sequel.
During the days of their love’s young dream, Ibsen
treated the “wild-flower” with a sort of shy and
distant chivalry at which the wood-gods must have
smiled. He avoided even touching her hand, and
always addressed her by the “De” (you) of formal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>politeness. But when they met again after many
years, he a famous poet and she a middle-aged matron,
he instinctively adopted the “Du” (thou) of affectionate
intimacy, and she responded in kind. He asked
her whether she had recognised herself in any of his
works, and she replied: “I really don’t know, unless
it be in the parson’s wife in <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite>, with her
eight children and her perpetual knitting.” “Ibsen
protested,” says Herr Paulsen, in whose <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Samliv
med Ibsen</cite></span> a full account of the episode may be read.
It is interesting to note that the lady did not
recognise herself in Eline Gyldenlöve, any more than
we can.</p>

<p class='c012'>It must have been less than a year after the production
of <cite>Lady Inger</cite> that Ibsen made the acquaintance
of the lady who was to be his wife.
Susanna Dåe Thoresen was a daughter (by his second
marriage) of Provost<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Thoresen, of Bergen, whose
third wife, Magdalene Krag, afterwards became an
authoress of some celebrity. It is recorded that
Ibsen’s first visit to the Thoresen household took
place on January 7, 1856,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and that on that occasion,
speaking to Susanna Thoresen, he was suddenly moved
to say to her: “You are now Elina, but in time you
will become Lady Inger.” Twenty years later, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>Christmas 1876, he gave his wife a copy of the German
translation of <cite>Lady Inger</cite>, with the following inscription
on the fly-leaf:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This book is by right indefeasible thine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in spirit art born of the Östråt line.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In <cite>Lady Inger</cite> Ibsen has chosen a theme from the
very darkest hour of Norwegian history. King
Sverre’s democratic monarchy, dating from the beginning
of the thirteenth century, had paralysed the
old Norwegian nobility. One by one the great families
died out, their possessions being concentrated in the
hands of the few survivors, who regarded their wealth
as a privilege unhampered by obligations. At the
beginning of the sixteenth century, then, patriotism
and public spirit were almost dead among the nobles,
while the monarchy, before which the old aristocracy
had fallen, was itself dead, or rather merged (since
1380) in the Crown of Denmark. The peasantry, too,
had long ago lost all effective voice in political affairs;
so that Norway lay prone and inert at the mercy of
her Danish rulers. It is at the moment of deepest
national degradation that Ibsen has placed his tragedy;
and the degradation was, in fact, even deeper than he
represents it, for the longings for freedom, the stirrings
of revolt, which form the motive-power of the
action, are invented, or at any rate idealised, by the
poet. Fru Inger Ottisdatter Gyldenlöve was, in fact,
the greatest personage of her day in Norway. She
was the best-born, the wealthiest, and probably the
ablest woman in the land. At the time when Ibsen
wrote, little more than this seems to have been
known of her; so that in making her the victim of
a struggle between patriotic duty and maternal love,
he was perhaps poetising in the absence of positive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>evidence, rather than in opposition to it. Subsequent
research, unfortunately, has shown that Fru Inger
was but little troubled with patriotic aspirations.
She was a hard and grasping woman, ambitious of
social power and predominance, but inaccessible, or
nearly so, to national feeling. It was from sheer
social ambition, and with no qualms of patriotic conscience,
that she married her daughters to Danish
noblemen. True, she lent some support to the insurrection
of the so-called “Dale-junker,” a peasant
who gave himself out as the heir of Sten Sture, a
former regent of Sweden; but there is not a tittle of
ground for making this pretender her son. He might,
indeed, have become her son-in-law, for, speculating
on his chances of success, she had betrothed one of
her daughters to him. Thus the Fru Inger of Ibsen’s
play is, in her character and circumstances, as much a
creation of the poet’s as though no historic personage
of that name had ever existed. Olaf Skaktavl, Nils
Lykke, and Eline Gyldenlöve are also historic names;
but with them, too, Ibsen has dealt with the utmost
freedom. The real Nils Lykke was married in
1528 to the real Eline Gyldenlöve. She died four
years later, leaving him two children; and thereupon
he would fain have married her sister Lucia. Such
a union, however, was regarded as incestuous, and
the lovers failed in their effort to obtain a special
dispensation. Lucia then became her brother-in-law’s
mistress, and bore him a son. But the ecclesiastical
law was in those days not to be trifled with; Nils
Lykke was thrown into prison for his crime, condemned,
and killed in his dungeon, in the year of
grace 1535. Thus there was a tragedy ready-made in
Ibsen’s material, though it was not the tragedy he
chose to write.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>The Bergen public did not greatly take to <cite>Lady
Inger</cite>, and it was performed, in its novelty, only twice.
Nor is the reason far to seek. The extreme complexity
of the intrigue, and the lack of clear guidance
through its mazes, probably left the Bergen audiences
no less puzzled than the London audiences who saw
the play at the Scala Theatre in 1906.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It is a play
which can be appreciated only by spectators who know
it beforehand. Such audiences it has often found in
Norway, where it was revived at the Christiania
Theatre in 1875; but in Denmark and Germany,
though it has been produced several times, it has
never been very successful. We need go no further
than the end of the first act to understand the reason.
On an audience which knows nothing of the play, the
sudden appearance of a “Stranger,” to whose identity
it has not the slightest clue, can produce no effect
save one of bewilderment. To rely on such an incident
for what was evidently intended to be a thrilling
“curtain,” was to betray extreme inexperience; and
this single trait is typical of much in the play. Nevertheless
<cite>Lady Inger</cite> marks a decisive advance in Ibsen’s
development. It marks, one may say, the birth of his
power of invention. He did not as yet know how to
restrain or clarify his invention, and he made clumsy
use of the stock devices of a bad school. But he
had once for all entered upon that course of technical
training which it took him five-and-twenty years to
complete. He was learning much that he was afterwards
to unlearn; but had he not undergone this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>apprenticeship, he would never have been the master
he ultimately became.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Ibsen entered upon his duties at the Bergen
Theatre, the influence of Eugène Scribe and his
imitators was at its very height. Of the 145
plays produced during his tenure of office, more
than half (seventy-five) were French, twenty-one
being by Scribe himself, and at least half the remainder
by adepts of his school, Bayard, Dumanoir, Mélesville,
&amp;c. It is to this school that Ibsen, in <cite>Lady
Inger</cite>, proclaims his adherence; and he did not finally
shake off its influence until he wrote the Third Act of
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> in 1879. Although the romantic
environment of the play, and the tragic intensity of
the leading character, tend to disguise the relationship,
there can be no doubt that <cite>Lady Inger</cite> is, in essence,
simply a French drama of intrigue, constructed after
the method of Scribe, as exemplified in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Adrienne
Lecouvreur</cite></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Contes de la Reine de Navarre</cite></span>,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and a
dozen other French plays, with the staging of which
the poet was then occupied. It might seem that the
figure of Elina, brooding over the thought of her dead
sister, coffined in the vault below the banqueting-hall,
belonged rather to German romanticism; but there
are plenty of traces of German romanticism even in
the French plays with which the good people of
Bergen were regaled. For the suggestion of grave-vaults
and coffined heroines, for example, Ibsen need
have gone no further than Dumas’s <cite>Catherine Howard</cite>,
which he produced in March 1853. I do not, however,
pretend that his romantic colouring came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>him from France. It came to him, doubtless, from
Germany, by way of Denmark. My point is that the
conduct of the intrigue in <cite>Lady Inger</cite> shows the most
unmistakable marks of his study of the great French
plot-manipulators. Its dexterity and its artificiality
alike are neither German nor Danish, but French.
Ibsen had learnt the great secret of Scribe—the secret
of dramatic movement. The play is full of those
ingenious complications, mistakes of identity, and
rapid turns of fortune by which Scribe enchained
the interest of his audiences. Its central theme—a
mother plunging into intrigue and crime for
the advancement of her son, only to find that her
son himself has been her victim—is as old as
Greek tragedy. The secondary story, too—that of
Elina’s wild infatuation for the betrayer and practically
the murderer of her sister—could probably
be paralleled in the ballad literature of Scotland,
Germany, or Denmark, and might, indeed, have
been told, in verse or prose, by Sir Walter Scott.
But these very un-Parisian elements are handled
in a fundamentally Parisian fashion, and Ibsen is
clearly fascinated, for the time, by the ideal of
what was afterwards to be known as the “well-made
play.” The fact that the result is in reality
an ill-made play in no way invalidates this theory.
It is perhaps the final condemnation of the well-made
play that in nine cases out of ten—and even
in the hands of far more experienced playwrights
than the young Bergen “theatre-poet”—it is apt to
prove ill-made after all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Far be it from me, however, to speak in pure
disparagement of <cite>Lady Inger</cite>. With all its defects,
it seems to me manifestly the work of a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>poet—the only one of Ibsen’s plays prior to <cite>The
Vikings at Helgeland</cite> of which this can be said.
It may be that early impressions mislead me; but
I still cannot help seeing in Lady Inger a figure of
truly tragic grandeur; in Nils Lykke one of the
few really seductive seducers in literature; and in
many passages of the dialogue, the touch of a master
hand.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE FEAST AT SOLHOUG</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='c011'>Exactly a year after the production of <cite>Lady Inger of
Östråt</cite>—that is to say on the “Foundation Day” of
the Bergen Theatre, January 2, 1856—<cite>The Feast at
Solhoug</cite> was produced. The poet himself has written
its history in full in the Preface to the second edition
(see p. <a href='#Page_183'>183</a>). The only comment that need be made
upon his rejoinder to his critics has been made, with
perfect fairness as it seems to me, by George Brandes
in the following passage:<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> “No one who is unacquainted
with the Scandinavian languages can fully
understand the charm that the style and melody of
the old ballads exercise upon the Scandinavian mind.
The beautiful ballads and songs of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</cite></span>
have perhaps had a similar power over German
minds; but, as far as I am aware, no German poet
has ever succeeded in inventing a metre suitable for
dramatic purposes, which yet retained the mediæval
ballad’s sonorous swing and rich aroma. The explanation
of the powerful impression produced in its
day by Henrik Hertz’s <cite>Svend Dyring’s House</cite> is to be
found in the fact that in it, for the first time, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>problem was solved of how to fashion a metre akin to
that of the heroic ballads, a metre possessing as great
mobility as the verse of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Niebelungenlied</cite></span>, along with
a dramatic value not inferior to that of the iambic
pentameter. Henrik Ibsen, it is true, has justly
pointed out that, as regards the mutual relations of
the principal characters, <cite>Svend Dyring’s House</cite> owes
more to Kleist’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Käthchen von Heilbronn</cite></span> than <cite>The
Feast at Solhoug</cite> owes to <cite>Svend Dyring’s House</cite>. But
the fact remains that the versified parts of the dialogue
of both <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> and <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite> are
written in that imitation of the tone and style of the
heroic ballad, of which Hertz was the happily-inspired
originator. There seems to me to be no depreciation
whatever of Ibsen in the assertion of Hertz’s right to
rank as his model. Even the greatest must have learnt
from some one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The question is, to put it in a nutshell: Supposing
Hertz had never adapted the ballad measures to dramatic
purposes, would Ibsen have written <cite>The Feast
at Solhoug</cite>, at any rate in its present form? I think
we must answer: Almost certainly, no.</p>

<p class='c012'>But while the influence of Danish lyrical romanticism
is apparent in the style of the play, the structure,
as it seems to me, shows no less clearly that influence
of the French plot-manipulators which we found so
unmistakably at work in <cite>Lady Inger</cite>. Despite its
lyrical dialogue, <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> has that crispness
of dramatic action which marks the French plays
of the period. It may indeed be called Scribe’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Bataille de Dames</cite></span> writ tragic. Here, as in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Bataille
de Dames</cite></span> (one of the earliest plays produced under
Ibsen’s supervision), we have the rivalry of an older
and a younger woman for the love of a man who is
proscribed on an unjust accusation, and pursued by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>the emissaries of the royal power. One might even,
though this would be forcing the point, find an analogy
in the fact that the elder woman (in both plays a
strong and determined character) has in Scribe’s comedy
a cowardly suitor, while in Ibsen’s tragedy, or melodrama,
she has a cowardly husband. In every other
respect the plays are as dissimilar as possible; yet it
seems to me far from unlikely that an unconscious
reminiscence of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Bataille de Dames</cite></span> may have contributed
to the shaping of <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> in
Ibsen’s mind. But more significant than any resemblance
of theme is the similarity of Ibsen’s whole
method to that of the French school—the way, for
instance, in which misunderstandings are kept up
through a careful avoidance of the use of proper names,
and the way in which a cup of poison, prepared for
one person, comes into the hands of another person,
is, as a matter of fact, drunk by no one, but occasions
the acutest agony to the would-be poisoner. All this
ingenious dovetailing of incidents and working-up of
misunderstandings, Ibsen unquestionably learned from
the French. The French language, indeed, is the only
one which has a word—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>quiproquo</i></span>—to indicate the class
of misunderstanding which, from <cite>Lady Inger</cite> down to
<cite>The League of Youth</cite>, Ibsen employed without scruple.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ibsen’s first visit to the home of his future wife took
place five days after the production of <cite>The Feast at
Solhoug</cite>. It seems doubtful whether this was actually
his first meeting with her;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> but at any rate we can
scarcely suppose that he knew her during the previous
summer, when he was writing his play. It is a curious
coincidence, then, that he should have found in
Susanna Thoresen and her sister Marie very much the
same contrast of characters which had occupied him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>his first dramatic effort, <cite>Catilina</cite>, and which had formed
the main subject of the play he had just produced.
It is less wonderful that the same contrast should so
often recur in his later works, even down to <cite>John
Gabriel Borkman</cite>. Ibsen was greatly attached to his
gentle and retiring sister-in-law, who died unmarried
in 1874.</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> has been translated by Miss
Morison and myself, only because no one else could be
found to undertake the task. We have done our best;
but neither of us lays claim to any great metrical skill,
and the light movement of Ibsen’s verse is often, if
not always, rendered in a sadly halting fashion. It is,
however, impossible to exaggerate the irregularity of
the verse in the original, or its defiance of strict metrical
law. The normal line is one of four accents; but
when this is said, it is almost impossible to arrive at
any further generalisation. There is a certain lilting
melody in many passages, and the whole play has not
unfairly been said to possess the charm of a northern
summer night, in which the glimmer of twilight gives
place only to the gleam of morning. But in the main
(though much better than its successor, <cite>Olaf Liliekrans</cite>)
it is the weakest thing that Ibsen admitted into
the canon of his works. He wrote of it in 1870 as “a
study which I now disown”; and had he continued in
that frame of mind, the world would scarcely have
quarrelled with his judgment. At worst, then, my
collaborator and I cannot be accused of marring a
masterpiece; but for which assurance we should probably
have shrunk from the attempt.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>LOVE'S COMEDY</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='c011'><span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Kærlighedens Komedie</cite></span> was published at Christiania
in 1862. The polite world—so far as such a thing
existed at that time in the Northern capital—received
it with an outburst of indignation not now entirely
easy to understand. It has indeed faults enough. The
character-drawing is often crude, the action, though
full of effective by-play, extremely slight, and the
sensational climax has little relation to human nature
as exhibited in Norway, or out of it, at that or any
other time. But the sting lay in the unflattering
veracity of the piece as a whole; in the merciless
portrayal of the trivialities of persons, or classes,
high in their own esteem; in the unexampled effrontery
of bringing a clergyman upon the stage. All
these have long since passed in Scandinavia, into the
category of the things which people take with their
Ibsen as a matter of course, and the play is welcomed
with delight by every Scandinavian audience. But
in 1862 the matter was serious, and Ibsen meant it to
be so.</p>

<p class='c012'>For they were years of ferment—those six or seven
which intervened between his return to Christiania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>from Bergen in 1857, and his departure for Italy in
1864. As director of the newly founded “Norwegian
Theatre,” Ibsen was a prominent member of the little
knot of brilliant young writers who led the nationalist
revolt against Danish literary tradition, then still
dominant in well-to-do, and especially in official,
Christiania. Well-to-do and official Christiania met
the revolt with contempt. Under such conditions,
the specific literary battle of the Norwegian with the
Dane easily developed into the eternal warfare of
youthful idealism with “respectability” and convention.
Ibsen had already started work upon the greatest
of his Norse Histories—<cite>The Pretenders</cite>. But history
was for him little more than material for the illustration
of modern problems; and he turned with zest
from the task of breathing his own spirit into the
stubborn mould of the thirteenth century, to hold up
the satiric mirror to the suburban drawing-rooms of
Christiania, and to the varied phenomena current
there,—and in suburban drawing-rooms elsewhere,—under
the name of Love.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite> is much more than a satire, and
its exuberant humour has a bitter core; the laughter
that rings through it is the harsh, implacable laughter
of Carlyle. His criticism of commonplace love-making
is at first sight harmless and ordinary enough.
The ceremonial formalities of the continental <cite>Verlobung</cite>,
the shrill raptures of aunts and cousins over the
engaged pair, the satisfied smile of enterprising materfamilias
as she reckons up the tale of daughters or of
nieces safely married off under her auspices; or,
again, the embarrassments incident to a prolonged
<cite>Brautstand</cite> following a hasty wooing, the deadly effect
of familiarity upon a shallow affection, and the anxious
efforts to save the appearance of romance when its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>zest has departed—all these things had yielded such
“comedy” as they possess to many others before Ibsen,
and an Ibsen was not needed to evoke it. But if we
ask what, then, is the right way from which these
“comic” personages in their several fashions diverge;
what is the condition which will secure courtship
from ridicule, and marriage from disillusion, Ibsen
abruptly parts company with all his predecessors.
“‘Of course,’ reply the rest in chorus, ‘a deep and
sincere love’;—‘together,’ add some, 'with prudent
good sense.'” The prudent good sense Ibsen allows;
but he couples with it the startling paradox that the
first condition of a happy marriage is the absence of
love, and the first condition of an enduring love the
absence of marriage.</p>

<p class='c012'>The student of the latter-day Ibsen is naturally
somewhat taken aback to find the grim poet of
Doubt, whose task it seems to be to apply a corrosive
criticism to modern institutions in general and
to marriage in particular, gravely defending the
“marriage of convenience.” And his amazement
is not diminished by the sense that the author of
this plea for the loveless marriage, which poets
have at all times scorned and derided, was himself
beyond question a poet, ardent, brilliant, and
young, and himself, what is more, quite recently
and beyond question happily, married. The truth
is that there are two men—in Ibsen an idealist,
exalted to the verge of sentimentality, and a critic,
hard, inexorable, remorseless, to the verge of cynicism.
What we call his “social philosophy” is a
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus vivendi</i></span> arrived at between them. Both agree
in repudiating “marriage for love”; but the idealist
repudiates it in the name of love, the critic in the
name of marriage. Love, for the idealist Ibsen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>is a passion which loses its virtue when it reaches
its goal, which inspires only while it aspires, and
flags bewildered when it attains. Marriage, for
the critic Ibsen, is an institution beset with pitfalls
into which those are surest to step who enter
in blinded with love. In the latter dramas the
tragedy of married life is commonly generated by
other forms of blindness—the childish innocence of
Nora, the maidenly ignorance of Helena Alving,
neither of whom married precisely “for love”; here
it is blind Love alone who, to the jealous eye of the
critic, plays the part of the Serpent in the Edens
of wedded bliss. There is, it is clear, an element of
unsolved contradiction in Ibsen’s thought;—Love is
at once so precious and so deadly, a possession so
glorious that all other things in life are of less worth,
and yet capable of producing only disastrously illusive
effects upon those who have entered into the relations
to which it prompts. But with Ibsen—and it is a
grave intellectual defect—there is an absolute antagonism
between spirit and form. An institution is
always, with him, a shackle for the free life of souls,
not an organ through which they attain expression;
and since the institution of marriage cannot but be,
there remains as the only logical solution that which
he enjoins—to keep the soul’s life out of it. To
“those about to marry,” Ibsen therefore says in effect,
“Be sure you are not in love!” And to those who
are in love he says, “Part!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is easy to understand the irony with which a man
who thought thus of love contemplated the business
of “love-making,” and the ceremonial discipline of
Continental courtship. The whole unnumbered tribe
of wooing and plighted lovers were for him unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>actors in a world-comedy of Love’s contriving—naïve
fools of fancy, passionately weaving the cords that
are to strangle passion. Comedy like this cannot be
altogether gay; and as each fresh romance decays
into routine, and each aspiring passion goes out
under the spell of a vulgar environment, or submits
to the bitter salvation of a final parting, the
ringing laughter grows harsh and hollow, and notes
of ineffable sadness escape from the poet’s Stoic self-restraint.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ibsen had grown up in a school which cultivated the
romantic, piquant, picturesque in style; which ran
riot in wit, in vivacious and brilliant imagery, in
resonant rhythms and telling double rhymes. It must
be owned that this was not the happiest school for a
dramatist, nor can <cite>Love’s Comedy</cite> be regarded, in the
matter of style, as other than a risky experiment which
nothing but the sheer dramatic force of an Ibsen could
have carried through. As it is, there are palpable
fluctuations, discrepancies of manner; the realism of
treatment often provokes a realism of style out of
keeping with the lyric afflatus of the verse; and we
pass with little warning from the barest colloquial
prose to strains of high-wrought poetic fancy. Nevertheless,
the style, with all its inequalities, becomes in
Ibsen’s hands a singularly plastic medium of dramatic
expression. The marble is too richly veined for ideal
sculpture, but it takes the print of life. The wit,
exuberant as it is, does not coruscate indiscriminately
upon all lips; and it has many shades and
varieties—caustic, ironical, imaginative, playful,
passionate—which take their temper from the speaker’s
mood.</p>

<p class='c027'>I might call on you for both; I might——;

<p class='c027'>Know then that the time seems now to be
drawing nigh, towards which the Danish Council
have been working for many a year—the
time, I mean, for them to strike the last blow
at our rights and our freedom. Therefore must
we now——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>No; we must gain breathing-time. The
Council is now assembled at Copenhagen, considering
how best to go to work. Most of them
hold, ’tis said, that there can be no end to dissensions
till Norway and Denmark are one; for
should we still possess our rights as a free land
when the time comes to choose the next king, ’tis
most like that the feud will break out openly.
Now the Danish councillors would hinder
this——</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Elina.</span></div>

<p class='c027'>No, we will not endure it. But to take up
arms—to declare open war—what would come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of that, so long as we are not united? And
were we ever less united in this land than we
are even now?—No, if aught is to be accomplished,
it must be secretly and in silence.
Even as I said, we must have time to draw
breath. In the South, a good part of the nobles
are for the Dane; but here in the North they
are still in doubt. Therefore has King Frederick
sent hither one of his most trusted councillors,
to assure himself with his own eyes how
we stand affected.</p>

Three years later, when you forbade Lucia to

saw you. It was at Akershus<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> in the house of
Knut Alfson and his wife. You were little
more than a child then; yet were you bold as the
soaring falcon, and wild and headstrong too at
times. Many were the wooers around you. I
too held you dear—dear as no woman before or
since. But you cared for nothing, thought of
nothing, save your country’s evil case and its
great need.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Olaf Skaktavl.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Call it what you will; but one thing I know—even
the old and sober men among us thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>it written in the counsels of the Lord on high
that you were she who should break our thraldom
and win us all our rights again. And
more: you yourself then thought as we did.</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>You <em class='gesperrt'>could</em> have been the chosen one had
you but willed it. You came of the noblest
blood in Norway; power and riches were soon
to be yours; and you had an ear for the cries
of anguish—then!</p>

<p class='c027'>Do you remember that afternoon when Henrik
Krummedike and the Danish fleet anchored
off Akershus? The captains of the fleet offered
terms of peace, and, trusting to the safe-conduct,
Knut Alfson rowed on board. Three
hours later, we bore him through the castle
gate——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>The best heart in Norway burst, when
Krummedike’s hirelings struck him down. Methinks
I still can see the long procession that
passed into the banquet-hall, heavily, two by
two. There he lay on his bier, white as a spring
cloud, with the axe-cleft in his brow. I may
safely say that the boldest men in Norway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>were gathered there that night. Lady Margrete
stood by her dead husband’s head, and we
swore as one man to venture lands and life to
avenge this last misdeed and all that had gone
before.—Inger Gyldenlöve,—who was it that
burst through the circle of men? A maiden—almost
a child—with fire in her eyes and her
voice half choked with tears.—What was it she
swore? Shall I repeat your words?</p>

  </div>

<p class='c027'>And how did the others keep their promise?
I speak not of you, Olaf Skaktavl, but of your
friends, all Norway’s nobles? Not one of them,
in all these years, has had the courage to be a

    <div><span class='sc'>Olaf Skaktavl.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>I know what you would say. Why have they
bent to the yoke, and not defied the tyrants to
the last? ’Tis but too true; there is base metal
enough in our noble houses nowadays. But had
they held together—who knows what then might
have been? And you could have held them together,
for before you all had bowed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Finn.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Ay; a stranger came an hour since.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>[<i>Softly, to</i> <span class='sc'>Jens Bielke</span>.] He is here.
[<i>Turns again to</i> <span class='sc'>Finn</span>.] Would you know
him again? Have you seen him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Finn.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Nay, none has seen him, that I know, but
the gatekeeper. He was brought at once to
Lady Inger, and she——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Well? What of her? He is not gone again
already?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><span class='sc'>Finn.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>No; but it seems she holds him hidden in one
of her own rooms; for——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>It is well.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>[<i>Whispers.</i>] Then the first thing is to put
a guard on the gate; so are we sure of him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>[<i>With a smile.</i>] H’m! [<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Finn</span>.] Tell
me—is there any way of leaving the castle, save
by the gate? Gape not at me so! I mean—can
one escape from Östråt unseen, though the
castle gate be barred?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Finn.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Nay, that I know not. ’Tis true they talk of
secret ways in the vaults beneath; but no one
knows them save Lady Inger—and mayhap Mistress
Elina.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c027'>The devil!</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>It is well. You may go.</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Finn.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Should you need me in aught again, you have
but to open the second door on the right in the
Banquet Hall, and I shall presently be at hand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Good.</p>

<p class='c027'>[<i>Points to the entrance-door.</i> <span class='sc'>Finn</span> <i>goes
out.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Now, by my soul, dear friend and brother—this
campaign is like to end but scurvily for both
of us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Oh—not for me, I hope.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Say you so? First of all, there is little honour
to be won in hunting an overgrown whelp
like this Nils Sture. Are we to think him mad
or in his sober senses after the pranks he has
played? First he breeds bad blood among the
peasants; promises them help and all their hearts
can desire;—and then, when it comes to the
pinch, off he runs to hide behind a petticoat!</p>

<p class='c027'>Moreover, to say truth, I repent that I followed
your counsel and went not my own way.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>[<i>To himself.</i>] Your repentance comes somewhat
late, my brother!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>For, let me tell you, I have never loved digging
at a badger’s earth. I looked for quite
other sport. Here have I ridden all the way
from Jæmteland with my horsemen, and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>got me a warrant from the Trondhiem commandant
to search for the rebel wheresoever I please.
All his tracks point towards Östråt——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>He is here! He is here, I tell you!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Were it not liker, in that case, that we had
found the gate barred and well guarded?
Would that we had; then could I have found
use for my men-at-arms——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>But instead, the gate is very courteously
thrown open to us. Mark now—if Inger Gyldenlöve’s
fame belie her not, I warrant she will
not let her guests lack for either meat or drink.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Ay, to turn us aside from our errand! And
what wild whim was that of yours to have me
leave my horsemen half a league from the
castle? Had we come in force——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>She had made us none the less welcome for
<em class='gesperrt'>that</em>. But mark well that then our coming
had made a stir. The peasants round about had
held it for an outrage against Lady Inger; she
had risen high in their favour once more—and
with that, look you, we were ill served.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>May be so. But what am I to do now?
Count Sture is in Östråt, you say. Ay, but how
does that profit me? Be sure Lady Inger Gyldenlöve
has as many hiding-places as the fox,
and more than one outlet to them. You and I,
alone, may go snuffing about here as long as we
please. I would the devil had the whole affair!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Well, then, my friend—if you like not the
turn your errand has taken, you have but to
leave the field to me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>To you? What will you do?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Caution and cunning may in this matter prove
of more avail than force of arms.—And to say
truth, Captain Jens Bielke—something of the
sort has been in my mind ever since we met in
Trondhiem yesterday.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Was that why you persuaded me to leave the
men-at-arms?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Both your purpose at Östråt and mine could
best be served without them; and so——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>The foul fiend seize you—I had almost said!
And me to boot! Might I not have known that
there is guile in all your dealings?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Be sure I shall need all my guile here, if I
am to face my foe with even weapons. And let
me tell you, ’tis of the utmost moment to me that
I acquit me of my mission secretly and well.
You must know that when I set forth I was
scarce in favour with my lord the King. He
held me in suspicion; though I dare swear
I have served him as well as any man could, in
more than one ticklish charge.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>That you may safely boast. God and all men
know you for the craftiest devil in all the three
kingdoms.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>I thank you! Though, after all, ’tis not much
to say. But this present errand I count as indeed
a crowning test of my powers; for here I
have to outwit a woman——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Ha-ha-ha! In <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> art you have long since
given crowning proofs of your skill, dear
brother. Think you we in Sweden know not the
song—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Fair maidens a-many they sigh and they pine:
“Ah God, that Nils Lykke were mine, mine,
mine!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Alas, ’tis women of twenty and thereabouts
that ditty speaks of. Lady Inger Gyldenlöve
is nigh on fifty, and wily to boot beyond all
women. ’Twill be no light matter to overmatch
her. But it <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> be done—at any cost.
Should I contrive to win certain advantages over
her that the King has long desired, I can reckon
on the embassy to France next spring. You
know that I spent three years at the University
in Paris? My whole soul is set on coming
thither again, most of all if I can appear in
lofty place, a king’s ambassador.—Well, then—is
it agreed—do you leave Lady Inger to me?
Remember—when you were last at Court in
Copenhagen, I made way for you with more
than one fair lady——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Nay, truly now—that generosity cost you little;
one and all of them were at your beck and
call. But let that pass; now that I have begun
amiss in this matter, I had as lief that you
should take it on your shoulders. Yet <em class='gesperrt'>one</em>
thing you must promise—if the young Count
Sture be in Östråt, you will deliver him into
my hands, dead or alive!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>You shall have him all alive. I, at any rate,
mean not to kill him. But now you must ride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>back and join your people. Keep guard on the
road. Should I mark aught that mislikes me,
you shall know it forthwith.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Good, good. But how am I to get out——?</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>The fellow that brought us in will show the

    <div><span class='sc'>Jens Bielke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Of course, of course. Well—good fortune to

<p class='c027'>[<i>Stands still for a while; then walks about the
room, looking round him; then he says softly:</i>]
At last, then, I am at Östråt—the ancient hall
whereof a child, two years ago, told me so much.</p>

<p class='c027'>Lucia. Ay, two years ago she was still a
child. And now—now she is dead. [<i>Hums
with a half-smile.</i>] “Blossoms plucked are
blossoms withered——”</p>

<div class='c028'>[<i>Looks round him again.</i></div>

<p class='c027'>Östråt. ’Tis as though I had seen it all before;
as though I were at home here.—In there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>is the Banquet Hall. And underneath is—the
grave-vault. It must be there that Lucia lies.</p>

<div class='direction'>
<p class='c029'>[<i>In a lower voice, half seriously, half with
forced gaiety.</i></p>
</div>
<p class='c027'>Were I timorous, I might well find myself
fancying that when I set foot within Östråt gate
she turned about in her coffin; as I crossed the
courtyard she lifted the lid; and when I named
her name but now, ’twas as though a voice summoned
her forth from the grave-vault.—Maybe
she is even now groping her way up the stairs.
The face-cloth blinds her, but she gropes on
and on in spite of it.</p>

<p class='c027'>Now she has reached the Banquet Hall! She
stands watching me from behind the door!</p>

<div class='direction'>
<p class='c029'>[<i>Turns his head backwards over one shoulder,
nods, and says aloud:</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Come nearer, Lucia! Talk to me a little!
Your mother keeps me waiting. ’Tis tedious
waiting—and you have helped me to while away
many a tedious hour——</p>

<div class='direction'>
<p class='c029'>[<i>Passes his hand over his forehead, and
takes one or two turns up and down.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Ah, there!—Right, right; there is the deep
curtained window. ’Tis there that Inger Gyldenlöve
is wont to stand gazing out over the
road, as though looking for one that never
comes. In there—[<i>looks towards the door on
the left</i>]—somewhere in there is Sister Elina’s
chamber. Elina? Ay, Elina is her name.</p>

<p class='c027'>Can it be that she is so rare a being—so wise
and so brave as Lucia fancied her? Fair, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>they say. But for a wedded wife—? I should
not have written so plainly.——</p>

me through a trap-door. A stab from behind—? No,
not that way either——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>

<p class='c027'>Truly, Sir Councillor, therein you judged
aright. Nils Lykke was indeed the last guest

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>As a friend? You add mockery to all the

you still dare——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>With your leave, Lady Inger Gyldenlöve—on
that matter we should scarce agree; for you
count as nothing what <i>I</i> lost by that same unhappy
chance. I purposed nought but in honour.
I was tired of my unbridled life; my thirtieth
year was already past; I longed to mate
me with a good and gentle wife. Add to all this
the hope of becoming your son-in-law——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

<p class='c027'>Beware, Sir Councillor! I have done all in
my power to hide my child’s unhappy fate.
But because it is out of sight, think not it is
out of mind. There may yet come a time——</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>You threaten me, Lady Inger? I have offered
you my hand in amity; you refuse to take
it. Henceforth, then, it is to be open war between
us?</p>

<p class='c027'>Not on <em class='gesperrt'>your</em> side, mayhap. <i>I</i> have never

    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c027'>I understand you. I have not been pliant
enough. It has not proved so easy as some of
you hoped to lure me over into your camp.—Yet
methinks you have nought to complain of.
My daughter Merete’s husband is your countryman—further
I cannot go. My position is no
easy one, Nils Lykke!</p>

<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>

All my care is to live quietly within my

<p class='c027'>Have you not seen, then, whither I have been

frankly and openly. Know, then, that the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and his Council see clearly that we can have no
sure footing in Norway so long as the nobles
and the people continue, as now, to think themselves
wronged and oppressed. We understand
to the full that willing allies are better than sullen
subjects; and we have therefore no heartier
wish than to loosen the bonds that hamper us,
in effect, even as straitly as you. But you will
scarce deny that the temper of Norway towards
us makes such a step too dangerous—so long as
we have no sure support behind us.</p>

<p class='c027'>Should naturally come from Sweden. But,
mark well, not so long as Gustav Vasa holds the
helm; his reckoning with Denmark is not yet
settled, and mayhap never will be. But a new
king of Sweden, who had the people with him,
and who owed his throne to the help of Denmark——.
Well, you begin to understand me?
<em class='gesperrt'>Then</em> we could safely say to you Norwegians:
“Take back your old ancestral rights; choose
you a ruler after your own mind; be our friends
in need, as we will be yours!”—Mark you well,
Lady Inger, herein is our generosity less than
it may seem; for you must see that, far from
weakening, ’twill rather strengthen us.</p>

<p class='c027'>And now that I have opened my heart to you
so fully, do you too cast away all mistrust.

She is bringing him! Ay, truly—she
is bringing him! The battle is half won. I

<p class='c027'>She is deep in the counsels of the rebels; she
started in terror when I named Sten Sture’s

<p class='c027'>And now? H’m! Since Lady Inger has been
simple enough to walk into the snare, Nils Sture
will not make many difficulties. A hot-blooded
boy, thoughtless and rash——. With my promise
of help he will set forth at once—unhappily
Jens Bielke will snap him up by the way—and
the whole rising will be nipped in the bud.</p>

<p class='c027'>And then? Then one further point to our
advantage. It is spread abroad that the young
Count Sture has been at Östråt,—that a Danish
envoy has had audience of Lady Inger—that
thereupon the young Count Nils has been

<p class='c027'>I speak of it, only to ask pardon for my
words; for no other reason, I swear to you. If
my fame—as I have too much cause to fear—has
gone before me to Östråt, you must needs
know enough of my life not to wonder that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>such things I should go to work something boldly.
I have met many women, Elina Gyldenlöve;
but not one have I found unyielding. Such lessons,
look you, teach a man to be secure. He
loses the habit of roundabout ways——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>’Tis as you guessed:—your fame has gone before
you, to Östråt, even as over all the land.
Nils Lykke’s name is never spoken save with
the name of some woman whom he has beguiled
and cast off. Some speak it in wrath, others
with laughter and wanton jeering at those weak-souled
creatures. But through the wrath and
the laughter and the jeers rings the song they
have made of you, full of insolent challenge, like
an enemy’s song of triumph.</p>

<p class='c027'>’Tis all this together that has begotten my
hate for you. You were ever in my thoughts,
and ever I longed to meet you face to face, that
you might learn that there are women on whom
your subtle speeches are lost—if you should
think to use them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c027'>You judge me unjustly, if you judge from
what rumour has told of me. Even if there be
truth in all you have heard,—you know not the
causes behind it.—As a boy of seventeen I began
my course of pleasure. I have lived full
fifteen years since then. Light women granted
me all that I would—even before the wish had
shaped itself into a prayer; and what I offered
them they seized with eager hands. You are
the first woman that has flung back a gift of
mine with scorn at my feet.</p>

<p class='c027'>Think not I reproach you. Rather I honour
you for it, as never before have I honoured
woman. But for this I reproach my fate—and
the thought is a gnawing pain to me—that you
and I were not sooner brought face to face.——Elina
Gyldenlöve! Your mother has told me
of you. While far from Östråt life ran its restless
course, you went your lonely way in silence,
living in your dreams and histories. Therefore
you will understand what I have to tell you.—Know,
then, that once I too lived even such a
life as yours. Methought that when I stepped
forth into the great world, a noble and stately
woman would come to meet me, and would
beckon to me and point out the path towards a
glorious goal.—I was deceived, Elina Gyldenlöve!
Women came to meet me; but <em class='gesperrt'>she</em> was
not among them. Ere yet I had come to full
manhood, I had learnt to despise them all.</p>

<p class='c027'>Was it my fault? Why were not the others
even as you?—I know the fate of your fatherland
lies heavy on your soul; and you know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>part I have in these affairs——. ’Tis said of
me that I am false as the sea-foam. Mayhap I
am; but if I be, it is women who have made
me so. Had I sooner found what I sought,—had
I met a woman proud and noble and high-souled
even as you, then had my path been different
indeed. At this moment, maybe, I had
been standing at your side as the champion of
all that suffer wrong in Norway’s land. For
<em class='gesperrt'>this</em> I believe: a woman is the mightiest power
in the world, and in her hand it lies to guide
a man whither God Almighty would have him
go.</p>

As you have dwelt here at Östråt,

felt a longing in your breast, an unconquerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>craving to know all that lies beyond the sea.
But you have not understood what ailed you.
At times you have thought it was the fate of
your fatherland that filled you with all these
restless broodings. You deceived yourself;—a
maiden so young as you has other food for
musing.——Elina Gyldenlöve! Have you
never had visions of an unknown power—a
strong mysterious might, that binds together the
destinies of mortals? When you dreamed of
the many-coloured life far out in the wide world—when
you dreamed of knightly jousts and
joyous festivals—saw you never in your dreams
a knight, who stood in the midst of the gayest
rout, with a smile on his lips and with bitterness
in his heart,—a knight that had once
dreamed a dream as fair as yours, of a woman
noble and stately, for whom he went ever a-seeking,
and ever in vain?</p>

<p class='c027'>Who are you, that have power to clothe my
most secret thoughts in words? How can you
tell me what I have borne in my inmost soul—yet
knew it not myself? How know you——?</p>

<p class='c027'>There is one thing in the world that might
drive a man to madness, but to think of it; and
that is the thought of what might have been,
had things but fallen out in this way or that.
Had I met you on my path while the tree of my
life was yet green and budding, at this hour,
mayhap, you had been——</p>

<p class='c027'>But forgive me, noble lady! Our speech of
these past few moments has made me forget
how we stand one to another. ’Twas as though

<p class='c027'>’Tis well;—and it may be that this openness
has already in part reconciled us. Ay—my
hope is yet bolder. The time may yet come
when you will think of the stranger knight

me not! I mean not <em class='gesperrt'>now</em>—but some
time, in the days to come. And that this may
be the less hard for you—and as I have begun

<p class='c027'>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Ah, I see the thought of my letter
still affrights you. Fear nought on that

love you not, and shall never come to love you.
Fear nothing, therefore, as I said before; I shall

take it up?</p>

<p class='c027'>You asked what I would with them? [<i>Softly.</i>]
When I stand again amid the fair ladies of
Denmark—when the music of the strings is

will I bring forth these flowers and tell a tale
of a young maiden sitting alone in a gloomy
black-beamed hall, far to the north in Norway——<span class='float-right'>[<i>Breaks off and bows respectfully.</i></span></p>

<p class='c027'>What is the meaning of it? Both Olaf Skaktavl

<p class='c027'>And to think I was so sure of success! If I

To be a laughing-stock both here

Inger into a trap—and given her cause the help

Nils Lykke were to love my daughter—as meseems
were like enough. I will persuade him
to tarry here; he shall learn to know Elina well.
She is both fair and wise.—Ah, if he should one

you, doubtless your sagacity has placed all
things beforehand in such train that your presence

to speak plainly, the thing is this: your
alliance with the disaffected in Sweden still
seems to me somewhat—how shall I call it?—somewhat
miraculous, Sir Councillor! I tell
you this frankly, dear Sir! The thought that
has moved the King’s Council to this secret step
is in truth most politic; but ’tis strangely at
variance with the deeds of certain of your countrymen

’Tis an age of tattling tongues. Many a scurril

Ere half a year is out, you will be all men’s
fable; people will stop and gaze after you on
the high roads; ’twill be: “Look, look; there
rides Sir Nils Lykke, that fared north to Östråt
to trap Inger Gyldenlöve, and was caught in his
own nets.”—Softly, softly, Sir Knight, why so
impatient! ’Tis not that <i>I</i> think so; I do but
forecast the thoughts of the malicious and evil-minded;
and of them, alas! there are many.—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Ay, ’tis shame; but so it is—you will reap
nought but mockery—mockery, because a woman
was craftier than you. “Like a cunning
fox,” men will say, “he crept into Östråt; like a
beaten hound he slunk away.”—And one thing
more: think you not that Peter Kanzler and his
friends will forswear your alliance, when ’tis
known that <i>I</i> venture not to fight under a standard
borne by you?</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Hearken, Sir Councillor! What you know
you shall know thoroughly. And you too, my
old and faithful friend!</p>

<p class='c027'>Listen then. To-night you bade me call to
mind that fatal day when Knut Alfson was slain
at Oslo. You bade me remember the promise I
made as I stood by his corpse amid the bravest
men in Norway. I was scarce full-grown then;
but I felt God’s strength in me, and methought,
as many have thought since, that the Lord
himself had set his mark on me and chosen
me to fight in the forefront for my country’s
cause.</p>

<p class='c027'>Was it pride of heart? Or was it a calling
from on high? That I have never clearly
known. But woe to whoso is charged with a
mighty task.</p>

<p class='c027'>For seven years I fear not to say that I kept
my promise faithfully. I stood by my countrymen
in all their sufferings and their need.
Playmates of mine, all over the land, were wives
and mothers now. I alone could give ear to no
wooer—not to one. That you know best, Olaf
Skaktavl!</p>

<p class='c027'>Then I saw Sten Sture for the first time.
Fairer man had never met my sight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><span class='sc'>Nils Lykke.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Ah, now it grows clear to me! Sten Sture
was then in Norway on a secret errand. We
Danes were not to know that he wished your
friends well.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>In the guise of a mean serving-man he lived
a whole winter under one roof with me.</p>

<p class='c027'>That winter I thought less and less of the
country’s weal.——So fair a man had I never
seen—and I had lived well-nigh five-and-twenty
years.</p>

<p class='c027'>Next autumn Sten Sture came once more; and
when he departed again he took with him, in all
secrecy, a little child. ’Twas not folk’s evil
tongues I feared; but our cause would have
suffered had it got abroad that Sten Sture stood
so near to me.</p>

<p class='c027'>The child was given to Peter Kanzler to rear.
I waited for better times, that were soon to come.
They never came. Sten Sture took a wife two
years later in Sweden, and, when he died, he
left a widow——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Olaf Skaktavl.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>——And with her a lawful heir to his name
and rights.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Time after time I wrote to Peter Kanzler beseeching
him to give me back my child. But
he was ever deaf to my prayers. “Cast in your
lot with us once for all,” he said, “and I send
your son back to Norway; not before.” But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>’twas even that I dared not do. We of the disaffected
party were then ill regarded by many
timorous folk in the land. Had these learnt how
things stood—oh, I know it!—to cripple the
mother they had gladly meted to the child the
fate that would have been King Christiern’s had
he not saved himself by flight.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c027'>But, besides that, the Danes, too, were active.
They spared neither threats nor promises to
force me to join them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Olaf Skaktavl.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>’Twas but reason. The eyes of all men were
fixed on you as on the vane that should show
them how to shape their course.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Lady Inger.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Then came Herlof Hyttefad’s rising. Do you
remember that time, Olaf Skaktavl? Was it
not as though a new spring had dawned over
the whole land! Mighty voices summoned me
to come forth;—yet I dared not. I stood doubting—far
from the strife—in my lonely castle.
At times it seemed as though the Lord God
himself were calling me; but then would come
the killing dread again to benumb my will.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Who will win?”—<em class='gesperrt'>that</em> was the question that
was ever ringing in my ears.</p>

<p class='c027'>’Twas but a short spring that had come to
Norway. Herlof Hyttefad, and many more with
him, were broken on the wheel during the
months that followed. None could call me to
account; yet there lacked not covert threats
from Denmark. What if they knew the secret?
At last methought they <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> know; I knew
not how else to understand their words.</p>

<p class='c027'>’Twas even in that time of agony that Gyldenlöve,
the High Steward, came hither and
sought me in marriage. Let any mother anguished
for her child think herself in my place!—A
month after, I was the High Steward’s wife—and homeless
in the hearts of my countrymen.</p>

<p class='c027'>Then came the quiet years. No one raised his
head any more. Our masters might grind us
down even as heavily as they listed. There
were times when I loathed myself; for what
had I to do? Nought but to endure terror and
scorn and bring forth daughters into the world.
My daughters! God must forgive me if I have
had no mother’s heart towards them. My wifely
duties were as serfdom to me; how then could
I love my daughters? Oh, how different with
my son! <em class='gesperrt'>He</em> was the child of my very soul.
He was the one thing that brought to mind the
time when I was a woman and nought but a
woman.—And him they had taken from me! He
was growing up among strangers, who might,
mayhap, be sowing in him the seed of corruption!
Olaf Skaktavl—had I wandered, like you,
on the lonely hills, hunted and forsaken, in winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and storm—if I had but held my child in
my arms,—trust me, I had not sorrowed and
wept so sore as I have sorrowed and wept for
him from his birth even to this hour!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Olaf Skaktavl.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>There is my hand. I have judged you too
hardly, Lady Inger! Command me even as before;
I will obey.—Ay, by all the saints, I know
what it is to sorrow for a child.</p>

seizing on your child as a pledge of your faith.</p>

no, no! My love is my pride. The little dog

while your looks and your words nourish me

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h3 class='c030'>THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE <br /> SECOND EDITION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I wrote <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> in Bergen in
the summer of 1855—that is to say, about
twenty-eight years ago.</p>

<p class='c012'>The play was acted for the first time on
January 2, 1856, also at Bergen, as a gala performance
on the anniversary of the foundation
of the Norwegian Stage.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I was then stage-manager of the Bergen
Theatre, it was I myself who conducted the rehearsals
of my play. It received an excellent,
a remarkably sympathetic interpretation. Acted
with pleasure and enthusiasm, it was received
in the same spirit. The “Bergen emotionalism,”
which is said to have decided the result
of the latest elections in those parts, ran high
that evening in the crowded theatre. The performance
ended with repeated calls for the author
and for the actors. Later in the evening
I was serenaded by the orchestra, accompanied
by a great part of the audience. I almost think
that I went so far as to make some kind of
speech from my window; certain I am that I
felt extremely happy.</p>

<p class='c012'>A couple of months later, <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>
was played in Christiania. There also it
was received by the public with much approbation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>and the day after the first performance
Björnson wrote a friendly, youthfully ardent
article on it in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Morgenblad</cite></span>. It was not a
notice or criticism proper, but rather a free,
fanciful improvisation on the play and the performance.</p>

<p class='c012'>On this, however, followed the real criticism,
written by the real critics.</p>

<p class='c012'>How did a man in the Christiania of those
days—by which I mean the years between 1850
and 1860, or thereabouts—become a real literary,
and in particular dramatic, critic?</p>

<p class='c012'>As a rule, the process was as follows: After
some preparatory exercises in the columns of
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Samfundsblad</cite></span>, and after having frequently
listened to the discussions which went on in Treschow’s
café or at “Ingebret’s” after the play,
the future critic betook himself to Johan Dahl’s
bookshop and ordered from Copenhagen a copy
of J. L. Heiberg’s <cite>Prose Works</cite>, among which
was to be found—so he had heard it said—an
essay entitled <cite>On the Vaudeville</cite>. This essay
was in due course read, ruminated on, and
possibly to a certain extent understood. From
Heiberg’s writings the young man, moreover,
learned of a controversy which that author had
carried on in his day with Professor Oehlenschläger
and with the Sorö poet, Hauch. And
he was simultaneously made aware that J. L.
Baggesen (the author of <cite>Letters from the Dead</cite>)
had at a still earlier period made a similar attack
on the great author who wrote both <cite>Axel and
Valborg</cite> and <cite>Hakon Jarl</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>A quantity of other information useful to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>critic was to be extracted from these writings.
From them one learned, for instance, that taste
obliged a good critic to be scandalised by a
hiatus. Did the young critical Jeronimuses of
Christiania encounter such a monstrosity in any
new verse, they were as certain as their prototype
in Holberg to shout their “Hoity-toity! the
world will not last till Easter!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The origin of another peculiar characteristic
of the criticism then prevalent in the Norwegian
capital was long a puzzle to me. Every
time a new author published a book or had a
little play acted, our critics were in the habit
of flying into an ungovernable passion and behaving
as if the publication of the book or the
performance of the play were a mortal insult
to themselves and the newspapers in which they
wrote. As already remarked, I puzzled long
over this peculiarity. At last I got to the bottom
of the matter. Whilst reading the Danish
<cite>Monthly Journal of Literature</cite> I was struck by
the fact that old State-Councillor Molbech was
invariably seized with a fit of rage when a
young author published a book or had a play
acted in Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus, or in a manner closely resembling this,
had the tribunal qualified itself, which now, in
the daily press, summoned <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>
to the bar of criticism in Christiania. It was
principally composed of young men who, as regards
criticism, lived upon loans from various
quarters. Their critical thoughts had long ago
been thought and expressed by others; their
opinions had long ere now been formulated elsewhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Their æsthetic principles were borrowed;
their critical method was borrowed; the
polemical tactics they employed were borrowed
in every particular, great and small. Their very
frame of mind was borrowed. Borrowing, borrowing,
here, there, and everywhere! The single
original thing about them was that they invariably
made a wrong and unseasonable application
of their borrowings.</p>

<p class='c012'>It can surprise no one that this body, the
members of which, as critics, supported themselves
by borrowing, should have presupposed
similar action on my part, as author. Two, possibly
more than two, of the newspapers promptly
discovered that I had borrowed this, that, and
the other thing from Henrik Hertz’s play, <cite>Svend
Dyring’s House</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is a baseless and indefensible critical
assertion. It is evidently to be ascribed to the
fact that the metre of the ancient ballads is employed
in both plays. But my tone is quite different
from Hertz’s; the language of my play
has a different ring; a light summer breeze plays
over the rhythm of my verse; over that of
Hertz’s brood the storms of autumn.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor, as regards the characters, the action, and
the contents of the plays generally, is there any
other or any greater resemblance between them
than that which is a natural consequence of the
derivation of the subjects of both from the narrow
circle of ideas in which the ancient ballads
move.</p>

<p class='c012'>It might be maintained with quite as much,
or even more, reason that Hertz in his <cite>Svend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Dyring’s House</cite> had borrowed, and that to no inconsiderable
extent, from Heinrich von Kleist’s
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Käthchen von Heilbronn</cite></span>, a play written at the
beginning of this century. Käthchen’s relation
to Count Wetterstrahl is in all essentials the
same as Ragnhild’s to the knight, Stig Hvide.
Like Ragnhild, Käthchen is compelled by a
mysterious, inexplicable power to follow the man
she loves wherever he goes, to steal secretly
after him, to lay herself down to sleep near him,
to come back to him, as by some innate compulsion,
however often she may be driven away.
And other instances of supernatural interference
are to be met with both in Kleist’s and in Hertz’s
play.</p>

<p class='c012'>But does any one doubt that it would be possible,
with a little good- or a little ill-will, to
discover among still older dramatic literature a
play from which it could be maintained that
Kleist had borrowed here and there in his
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Käthchen von Heilbronn</cite></span>? I, for my part, do
not doubt it. But such suggestions of indebtedness
are futile. What makes a work of art the
spiritual property of its creator is the fact that
he has imprinted on it the stamp of his own
personality. Therefore I hold that, in spite of
the above-mentioned points of resemblance,
<i>Svend Dyring’s House</i> is as incontestably and
entirely an original work by Henrik Hertz as
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Käthchen von Heilbronn</cite></span> is an original work by
Heinrich von Kleist.</p>

<p class='c012'>I advance the same claim on my own behalf
as regards <i>The Feast at Solhoug</i>, and I
trust that, for the future, each of the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>namesakes<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> will be permitted to keep, in its entirety,
what rightfully belongs to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>In writing of <i>The Feast at Solhoug</i> in connection
with <i>Svend Dyring’s House</i>, George
Brandes expresses the opinion, not that the
former play is founded upon any idea borrowed
from the latter, but that it has been written
under an influence exercised by the older author
upon the younger. Brandes invariably criticises
my work in such a friendly spirit that I
have all reason to be obliged to him for this
suggestion, as for so much else.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless I must maintain that he, too,
is in this instance mistaken. I have never
specially admired Henrik Hertz as a dramatist.
Hence it is impossible for me to believe that he
should, unknown to myself, have been able to
exercise any influence on my dramatic production.</p>

<p class='c012'>As regards this point and the matter in general,
I might confine myself to referring those
interested to the writings of Dr. Valfrid Vasenius,
lecturer on Æsthetics at the University of
Helsingfors. In the thesis which gained him his
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, <cite>Henrik Ibsen’s
Dramatic Poetry in its First Stage</cite> (1879), and
also in <cite>Henrik Ibsen: The Portrait of a Skald</cite>
(Jos. Seligman &amp; Co., Stockholm, 1882), Vasenius
states and supports his views on the subject
of the play at present in question, supplementing
them in the latter work by what I told
him, very briefly, when we were together at
Munich three years ago.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>But, to prevent all misconception, I will now
myself give a short account of the origin of
<cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>I began this Preface with the statement that
<cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite> was written in the summer
of 1855.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1854 I had written <cite>Lady Inger of Östråt</cite>.
This was a task which had obliged me to devote
much attention to the literature and history of
Norway during the Middle Ages, especially the
latter part of that period. I did my utmost to
familiarise myself with the manners and customs,
with the emotions, thoughts, and language,
of the men of those days.</p>

<p class='c012'>The period, however, is not one over which
the student is tempted to linger, nor does it present
much material suitable for dramatic treatment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Consequently I soon deserted it for the Saga
period. But the Sagas of the Kings, and in
general the more strictly historical traditions of
that far-off age, did not attract me greatly; at
that time I was unable to put the quarrels between
kings and chieftains, parties and clans,
to any dramatic purpose. This was to happen
later.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Icelandic “family” Sagas, on the
other hand, I found in abundance what I required
in the shape of human garb for the
moods, conceptions, and thoughts which at that
time occupied me, or were, at least, more or less
distinctly present in my mind. With these Old-Norse
contributions to the personal history of
our Saga period I had had no previous acquaintance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>I had hardly so much as heard them
named. But now N. M. Petersen’s excellent
translation—excellent, at least, as far as the
style is concerned—fell into my hands. In the
pages of these family chronicles, with their variety
of scenes and of relations between man
and man, between woman and woman, in short,
between human being and human being, there
met me a personal, eventful, really living life;
and as the result of my intercourse with all
these distinctly individual men and women,
there presented themselves to my mind’s eye the
first rough, indistinct outlines of <i>The Vikings
at Helgeland</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>How far the details of that drama then took
shape, I am no longer able to say. But I remember
perfectly that the two figures of which
I first caught sight were the two women who in
course of time became Hiördis and Dagny.
There was to be a great banquet in the play,
with passion-rousing, fateful quarrels during
its course. Of other characters and passions,
and situations produced by these, I meant to
include whatever seemed to me most typical of
the life which the Sagas reveal. In short, it
was my intention to reproduce dramatically exactly
what the Saga of the Volsungs gives in
epic form.</p>

<p class='c012'>I made no complete, connected plan at that
time; but it was evident to me that such a drama
was to be my first undertaking.</p>

<p class='c012'>Various obstacles intervened. Most of them
were of a personal nature, and these were probably
the most decisive; but it undoubtedly had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>its significance that I happened just at this time
to make a careful study of Landstad’s collection
of Norwegian ballads, published two years previously.
My mood of the moment was more in
harmony with the literary romanticism of the
Middle Ages than with the deeds of the Sagas,
with poetical than with prose composition, with
the word-melody of the ballad than with the
characterisation of the Saga.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus it happened that the fermenting, formless
design for the tragedy, <cite>The Vikings at Helgeland</cite>,
transformed itself temporarily into the
lyric drama, <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two female characters, the foster sisters
Hiördis and Dagny, of the projected tragedy,
became the sisters Margit and Signë of the
completed lyric drama. The derivation of the
latter pair from the two women of the Saga at
once becomes apparent when attention is drawn
to it. The relationship is unmistakable. The
tragic hero, so far only vaguely outlined, Sigurd,
the far-travelled Viking, the welcome guest
at the courts of kings, became the knight and
minstrel, Gudmund Alfson, who has likewise
been long absent in foreign lands, and has lived
in the king’s household. His attitude towards
the two sisters was changed, to bring it into accordance
with the change in time and circumstances;
but the position of both sisters to him
remained practically the same as that in the projected
and afterwards completed tragedy. The
fateful banquet, the presentation of which had
seemed to me of the first importance in my
original plan, became in the drama the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>upon which its personages made their appearance;
it became the background against which
the action stood out, and communicated to the
picture as a whole the general tone at which I
aimed. The ending of the play was, undoubtedly,
softened and subdued into harmony with
its character as drama, not tragedy; but orthodox
æstheticians may still, perhaps, find it disputable
whether, in this ending, a touch of pure
tragedy has not been left behind, to testify to
the origin of the drama.</p>

<p class='c012'>Upon this subject, however, I shall not enter
further at present. My object has simply been
to maintain and prove that the play under consideration,
like all my other dramatic works, is
an inevitable outcome of the tenor of my life
at a certain period. It had its origin within,
and was not the result of any outward impression
or influence.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, and no other, is the true account of the
genesis of <cite>The Feast at Solhoug</cite>.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>NOTES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><a href='#Page_304'>P. 18.</a> “<i>William Russel.</i>” An original historic tragedy,
founded upon the career of the ill-fated Lord William
Russell, by Andreas Munch, cousin of the historian P. A.
Munch. It was produced at Christiania in 1857, the year of
Ibsen’s return from Bergen, and reviewed by him in the
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Illustreret Nyhedsblad</cite></span> for that year, Nos. 51 and 52. Professor
Johan Storm of Christiania, to whose kindness I owe
these particulars, adds that “it is rather a fine play and
created a certain sensation in its time; but Munch is forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#Page_306'>P. 20.</a> <i>A grey old stager.</i> Ibsen’s friend P. Botten-Hansen,
author of the play <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Hyldrebryllupet</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#Page_347'>P. 59.</a> <i>A Svanhild like the old.</i> In the tale of the Völsungs
Svanhild was the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrun,—the
Siegfried and Kriemhild of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>. The
fierce king Jormunrek, hearing of her matchless beauty,
sends his son Randwer to woo her in his name. Randwer
is, however, induced to woo her in his own, and the girl
approves. Jormunrek thereupon causes Randwer to be
arrested and hanged, and meeting with Svanhild, as he and
his men ride home from the hunt, tramples her to death under
their horses’ hoofs. Gudrun incites her sons Sorli and
Hamdir to avenge their sister; they boldly enter Jormunrek’s
hall, and succeed in cutting off his hands and feet, but are
themselves slain by his men. This last dramatic episode is
told in the Eddic <cite>Hamthismol</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#Page_385'>P. 94.</a> <i>In the remotest east there grows a plant.</i> The germ
of the famous tea-simile is due to Fru Collett’s romance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>“The Official’s Daughters” (<i>cf.</i> Introduction, p. ix.). But
she exploits the idea only under a single and obvious aspect,
viz., the comparison of the tender bloom of love with the
precious firstling blade which brews the quintessential tea
for the Chinese emperor’s table; what the world calls love
being, like what it calls tea, a coarse and flavourless aftercrop.
Ibsen has, it will be seen, given a number of ingenious
developments to the analogy. I know Fru Collett’s work
only through the accounts of it given by Brandes and
Jæger.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#Page_428'>P. 135.</a> <i>Another Burns.</i> In the original: “Dölen”
(“The Dalesman”), that is A. O. Vinje, Ibsen’s friend and
literary comrade, editor of the journal so-called and hence
known familiarly by its name. See the Introduction.</p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#Page_455'>P. 160.</a> <i>Like Old Montanus.</i> The hero of Holberg’s
comedy <cite>Erasmus Montanus</cite>, who returns from foreign travel
to his native parish with the discovery that the world is not
flat. Public indignation is aroused, and Montanus finds it
expedient to announce that his eyes had deceived him, that
“the world <em>is</em> flat, gentlemen.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
